### 3. Expense Forecast
![Expense Forecast](visuals/plots/Expense_Forecast.png)
``` bash
1. Clear Upward Trend: The dark blue forecast line shows a steady increase in expenses over time. This suggests a gradual rise
in your spending habits, which could be due to lifestyle upgrades, inflation, or recurring commitments.

2. Strong Historical Fit: The black dots (actual data points) closely follow the forecast line, indicating that the Prophet model
 has captured your expense behavior accurately. This gives confidence in its future predictions.

3. Forecast Confidence: The light blue shaded region around the forecast line represents the uncertainty interval. While the model
 predicts a general upward trend, it also accounts for variability‚Äîespecially in months with irregular spending.

4. Seasonality Signals: The pattern hints at periodic spikes and dips, suggesting seasonal or cyclical spending behaviors. These
could be tied to annual events, travel, or festive purchases.

5. Planning Opportunity: With expenses projected to rise, this insight can help you proactively adjust budgets, set savings goals,
or explore cost-cutting strategies before the curve steepens.
